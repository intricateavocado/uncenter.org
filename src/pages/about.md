## long answer

### site generation/building
this website is 'self-coded'. however, much of the work is being done by a 'static site generator', in this case being [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). here's what they have to say about themselves:

Eleventy:
- is a simpler static siteÂ generator.

- quickly builds speedy web sites

- a popular modern web site generator.

for me, eleventy converts Markdown files (`.md`) into HTML pages, making it simply and easy to make the pages while letting me design the frontend.

### hosting the site
after all this, the website is still just a folder on my desktop (or rather some source code in [a Github repository](https://www.github.com/intricateavocado/site)). i make use of [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a partially-free hosting service, to auto-deploy my website from the afore-mentioned Github repository. 

### domain
this domain is being provided through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

### usage/view statistics
usage statistics are done using [umami](https://umami.is/), which is an open-source alternative to Google Analytics. it was a bit annoying to setup, but once it is running, the graphs and data presentation looks amazing. the postgresql database and hosting for that is through [Railway](https://railway.app/), a super convenient and free platform for hosting projects like this. 

### email service
my email service is with [Migadu](https://www.migadu.com/), which lets me manage my aliases and mailboxes easily and securely.
