[Looking for an about page *about me*?](/me).

### Site structure
This website is a self-coded project, with the help of a static site generator - [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). 11ty converts Markdown files into HTML pages, making it easy for me to design the frontend while keeping the process simple.

According to 11ty's website:
- Eleventy is a simple static site generator.
- It quickly builds fast websites.
- It's a popular modern web site generator.

for me, eleventy converts Markdown files (`.md`) into HTML pages, making it simply and easy to make the pages while letting me design the frontend.

### Site hosting
After the website is built, it's just a folder on my desktop (or source code in [a Github repository](https://www.github.com/uncenter/uncenter.org)). I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a partially-free hosting service, to auto-deploy the website from the Github repository.

### Domain proivder
The domain is provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

### Visitor analytics
Usage statistics are tracked using [umami](https://umami.is/), an open-source alternative to Google Analytics. Although it was a bit challenging to set up, the data presentation and graphs look great once it's up and running. The PostgreSQL database and hosting for Umami is provided by [Railway](https://railway.app/), a convenient and free platform for hosting projects like this.

### Email service
My email is managed through [Migadu](https://www.migadu.com/), which allows me to manage my aliases and mailboxes easily and securely.
