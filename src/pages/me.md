title: "Me"

I've talked a lot about development and this website, but I don't think I've really had a chance to talk about myself. Keep reading if you want to get to know me a bit better!

I am a high school student, and I row varsity crew for the school. I love to read, a lot of sci-fi and fantasy ^[I might publish a list of some of my top books if anyone is curious.]. As you probably know, I love programming (I'm not great at it yet - I'm always looking to learn :D), and I'm currently learning Rust 🦀. My programming career started a few years ago and kinda stagnated until this past year. I had started in Python, and hadn't really left that language, until a friend of mine ([Evan Boehs](https://boehs.org)) showed me his blog and encouraged me to do the same! I built it up, and "abandoned" it until the end of last year (2022), when I decided I needed change. I redeveloped and redesigned the whole thing. It looks quite different - if you have some spare time, you could check out previous iterations of my site on the Wayback Machine ^[I used to save snapshots of my site on the Wayback Machine, but I realized it is a pretty inefficient way of preserving it. I'm working on automatically screenshotting and saving the website, coming soon!]. I'm obviously still working on this website, but right now I'm pretty happy with it.

## Some other trivial things about me
- 🧩 I can solve a Rubik's cube (pretty quickly if I do say so).
- 📷 I enjoy taking photos with my DSLR and my drone!
- 🎮 I like to play video games.
- 🗣️ I'm currently learning 汉语/中文（Chinese 🇨🇳).
- 🎨 My favorite color scheme is Nord 🗻.
- 🏔️ I have summitted the tallest mountain in Africa.
- 🏎️ My favorite car is the 1958 Studebaker Goldenhawk [(you'll see why)](https://cdn-fastly.thetruthaboutcars.com/media/2022/06/30/8820382/rare-rides-the-very-luxurious-1958-studebaker-golden-hawk.jpg?size=720x845&nocrop=1).
- 🍎 I use MacOS (and iOS) since Linux is too complicated and Windows is... well... Windows.
