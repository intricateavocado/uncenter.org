This is my style guide! You can also read my [colophon page](/colophon) if you want to read how I _created_ this website. This document showcases the styles that I use on this website, and is meant to be a reference for myself and others.

{% info "Credit where credit is due" %}
This page is inspired and based of off [Binyamin's style guide](https://binyam.in/style/), which took inspiration from [Brian Devries's style guide](https://brianjdevries.com/style-guide/).

{% callout "Browser support for code styling", "info" %}
The above code block is using the [:has()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has) selector to blur the code that is not in focus. This is a new CSS selector that is not yet supported in all browsers. It should work in Chrome and Safari, but not in Firefox yet. I tried to enable it in Firefox with the `layout.css.has-selector.enabled` flag... and it looks like this:
{% image "images/has-selector-failed.png", "Screenshot of failed implementation of the :has() selector in Firefox" %}
It needs some work... but it's a start! For you Firefox users (_cough_ me _cough_), here's what it **should** look like:
{% image "images/has-selector-working.png", "Screenshot of working implementation of the :has() selector in Safari and Chrome" %}
{% endcallout %}
