# current

## uncenter.org
this very website! my current feature plans are:
- dark mode/light mode toggle

- improved navigation menus
- a blog!



# upcoming/planned

## databases
I'm working with a few databases right now using SQLite and hoping to develop a web app for them

## [randomfact](/projects/randomfact){.link-default}
discord py bot for a friend, might make it public, sends a random daily fact w/ customizable scheduling, history, and more commands

## [learn chinese app](/projects/learnchinese){.link-default}
this one is just a concept atm, but the idea is: an easy way to learn/study chinese characters with a dictionary, practice, stroke order, etc

## [wordle bot](/projects/wordle){.link-default}
my own wordle bot! just want to replicate some already existing designs and see how they work
