## uncenter.org
this very website! my current feature plans are:

- improved navigation menus


## databases
I'm working with a few databases right now using SQLite and hoping to develop a web app for them

## [randomfact](/projects/randomfact){.link}
python bot for a friend, might make it public, sends a random daily fact w/ customizable scheduling, history, and more commands

## [学汉语](/projects/learnchinese){.link}
this one is just a concept atm, but the idea is: an easy way to learn/study chinese characters with a dictionary, practice, stroke order, etc

my own wordle analytics and solver.  just want to replicate some already existing designs and see how they work
