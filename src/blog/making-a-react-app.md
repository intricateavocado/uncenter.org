<!--START-->
My humorous attempt at learning React.<!--END-->

## Why I'm learning React
As [@Boehs](https://boehs.org) keeps telling me, _don't learn React_. Apparently, I should learn something like [Solid](https://solidjs.com/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), the newer frameworks that are better than React. But I'm stubborn- I don't think I'll like it at all, however it could turn into a good learning experience (and some sort of "I told you so" moment for Boehs when I switch to Solid).

## My first React app
Anyone who knows the slightest thing about React has heard to never use `create-react-app` (CRA). So, that was out of the question. The [new React docs](https://beta.reactjs.org) **still** [suggest CRA](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/start-a-new-react-project#getting-started-with-a-minimal-toolchain), but they also provide some alternatives, such as [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and Parcel, build tools that are faster than CRA [^1]. I decided to give Vite a try. I was able to get a basic app up and running in less than 10 minutes. I'm not sure if I'll stick with Vite, but I'm definitely going to keep it in mind for future projects.

### Picking the project
I decided to make a simple stopwatch app. Nothing special, but maybe I can add some features like a countdown (timer) mode, an alarm mode, a Pomodoro timer, etc. I'm not sure if I'll add those features, but I'll see how it goes :eyes:. I'm also going to try to make it look nice, so I considered using a CSS framework like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), but I decided to just use plain CSS for now. I might add Tailwind later though!
