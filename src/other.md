## photography
I post mediocre photos on my instagram, [@illuminaphotos](https://www.instagram.com/illuminaphotos/){.social-link}! I use a [Canon EOS Rebel T7](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/dslr/eos-rebel-t7-ef-s-18-55mm-is-ii-kit){.external-link} DSLR for my groundwork, and for aerial I use a [DJI Mavic Air 2](https://www.dji.com/mavic-air-2){.external-link}. and before you ask, I am licensed!
