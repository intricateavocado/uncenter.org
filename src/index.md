I'm {{ site.author.name }}, a high school student passionate about programming and open source software. I'm currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), though I've mainly built websites with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com/), and [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) in the past. Some of my favorite projects include [small web apps](https://tree.uncenter.dev/), [browser extensions](https://github.com/catppuccin/github-file-explorer-icons), and [command-line interfaces](https://github.com/uncenter/purr) (CLIs) - [you can check out the full list](/projects).

I'm also interested in languages and linguistics, and I'm learning [Mandarin Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese) in school.

I use [Nix](https://nixos.org/) & [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to configure my macOS and WSL systems - see [my flake](https://github.com/uncenter/flake) for more.
